# OCR Text Extraction Project

## Overview

This project is focused on extracting structured data from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with EasyOCR. The script processes images containing text entries and organizes the extracted information into a structured format, which is then saved as an Excel file.

## Files

- **ocr_text_extraction.py**: The main Python script that extracts text from images and processes it into a structured format.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages to run the script.
- **project_report.pdf**: A brief report outlining the development process, challenges faced, and how they were addressed.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Update the `image_path` variable in `ocr_text_extraction.py` to point to your image file.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python ocr_text_extraction.py
     ```

3. **Output:**
   - The structured data will be saved to an Excel file named `extracted_data.xlsx`.
